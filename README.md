# Instructor:-

Instructor is often a library (like InstructorEmbedding from UKPLab) that you can install and use in your code. It provides pre-trained models that understand instructions to generate useful embeddings or outputs.

Itâ€™s not just a model, but usually a package or framework that wraps those models with code to easily apply instruction-following capabilities.

 # how it works means 
   - instructor :The instructor library enables parsing the natural language output of a language model into structured Pydantic models  

 - instructor.from_openai(client) wraps the OpenAI client so that you can request a response_model, which automatically parses and validates the model output.
